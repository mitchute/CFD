# Computational Fluid Dynamics
This is code devoted to solving partial differential equations typically encountered when solving heat condution or fluid flow equations.

## Source
Source will take from class note developed during Dr. Balaji Jayaraman's CFD course at Oklahoma State University.

## Documentation
Gonna try to ReadTheDocs and Sphinx for the first time.
